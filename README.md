# Introduction
basic implementation of a genetic algorithm

## Structure
Define a string and population size in driver.py. The algorithm will produce the specified string from a random list of strings. 
A random population will be generated, and will evolve each generation based on fitness. The evolution is based on a mating pool created from the strongest parents. The stronger a set of parents, the more they will appear in the mating pool.
